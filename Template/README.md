# Template

This library is used for generating sentences from csvs and saving them as input for NER models and for validation purposes.

The csvs had multiple versions, so there is no universal solution for this problem.

Running a script makes 3 variants(Basic, Negation, Word Order) for input and it also makes their true counterpart for validation.
